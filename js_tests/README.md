All cases come from [wpt(web-platform-test)](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt), which is descriped in [mozilla wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/Projects/web-platform-tests). I think this a reliable repo to test Web Audio API.

All passed wpt tests are put in wpt_test folder, other wpt tests that not be tested are list [here](../js_api_define/features.md).
